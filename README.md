# url-shortner
This is a small feature that I made, where it converts a regular URL into its 
condensed format. 


# Dependencies
1. `express`
2. `mongoose`
3. `nodemon`
4. `shorthash`


# Usage
* When the original URL is provided which might be several characters long, its shortened version will be returned.
* On entering the shortened URL user will be redirected to original URL.
